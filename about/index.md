I'm Andrew Hjortland, a PhD student at Purdue University in the department of
mechanical engineering. I'm studying automated fault detection and diagnostics
tools and fault impact evaluation methods with applications in optimal
HVAC systems operations. My advisor is Dr. Jim Braun.

## _Comfortably Air-Conditioned_ is:

* musings of a HVAC systems engineer and researcher
* and a personal blog for anything else I find interesting.
